# Setup of a Dell Boomi Atom on OpenShift

The deployment of the Atom on OpenShift is using a slightly different version of the Boomi Atom for Docker due to the facts that OpenShift has its own constraints (Pod will be assigned with a user ID generated by the platform, the root user cannot be used to run an image, etc).

I created a custom image to cope with the different constraints and allow the deployment of an Atom in OpenShift:  https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/anthonyrabiaza/openshift-boomi-atom/general
